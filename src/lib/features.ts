/**
 * Feature-flag registry, backed by Vercel Global Config (formerly "Edge
 * Config"). The connection string lives in the `GLOBAL_CONFIG` env var
 * (falling back to the legacy `EDGE_CONFIG` name), which
 * `@vercel/global-config` reads automatically.
 *
 * Flags are read fresh on every call — no caching beyond the current
 * request (no `unstable_cache`, no module-level variable) — so flipping a
 * flag in the Vercel dashboard is reflected within seconds, without a
 * redeploy. Any ambiguity (missing key, non-boolean value, store
 * unreachable or misconfigured) resolves to `false`. This system is
 * default-closed and must never throw or surface a 500.
 *
 * --- Adding a new feature later ---
 * 1. Add the key to the `Feature` union and `ALL_FEATURES` array below.
 * 2. In the Vercel dashboard, add the key (boolean) to the `features` item
 *    in the project's Global Config store.
 * 3. If it gates a whole route, add an entry to `GATED_PATHS` mapping the
 *    locale-stripped pathname (e.g. '/dashboard/reports') to the key —
 *    this wires up both the middleware redirect (src/proxy.ts) and is
 *    also checked directly inside the page itself.
 * 4. If it has a sidebar nav item, set `feature: '<key>'` on that item in
 *    src/components/core/dashboard/sidebar-content/index.tsx.
 * 5. Add `upgrade.features.<key>.body` to both locale files
 *    (src/localization/locales/{en,fr}.json), then run
 *    `npm run generate-translation`.
